Private cloud is a simple electron app that allows users to store files, images and access them locally or externally if they expose the ports.

It plays two roles:

If role host is chosen, then this PC becomes used as a network storage

If role consumer is chosen, then this PC can access other hosts on the network. When we choose one, we can see what files are there and edit/add them per host.

There is possibility to upload any file, where images can be seen also in a separate tab, filtered by categories.

This app can be ran by mobile devices, as well as windows and mac (arm), and windows on arm.

For frontend, we use angular 19 and TypeScript everywhere.
